# Neighborhood Map Project

## About
This project uses Google Maps API to create a neighborhood map with markers indicating local points of interest. It makes use of the Knockout.js library to instantly filter through points of interest using the text box.

Future updates will include making use of other 3rd party API's to provide information regarding points of interest which will be displayed via info windows above the map markers.
